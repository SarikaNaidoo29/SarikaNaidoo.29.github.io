<b><a id="interests">What am I working on</a></b><br>
In recent years, I've been interested in problems that involve the <i>creative and resourceful
application of NLP under severe constraints</i>, either from lack of data (e.g., low-resource languages,
multilingual NLP) or lack of compute (e.g., efficient NLP). If you're interested in these topics
and want to collaborate, then feel free to <a href="mailto:ljvmiranda@gmail.com">hit me up</a>!</p>



### Masters Thesis

My Masters thesis involves the prediction of protein functions using
autoencoder-based techniques. You can find an unpublished version of
my manuscript below:

- [Autoencoder-based Feature Extraction Techniques for Protein Function
  Prediction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/345u99e4anukj9u/main-latest.pdf?dl=0) _Masters Thesis_, Waseda University, Unpublished, June 2018.

In addition, here are some selected works during my time at the [Furuzuki
Neurocomputing Systems Laboratory
(NCLab)](https://www.waseda.jp/sem-hflab/nclab/index.html) in [Waseda
University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). Most of these are unpublished seminar presentations and reports:

- [Applying Reinforcement Learning to the Protein Folding Problem](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h4f5ybkn2bhssu7/lab2018applying.pdf?dl=0) _Laboratory Seminar Presentation_, April 2018.
- [Selective Feature Extraction via a Mutually-Competitive Autoencoder for Protein Function Prediction](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zh7d5z3jb5tiijv/midterms-handouts.pdf?dl=0) _Midterm Defense Presentation_, April 2018.
